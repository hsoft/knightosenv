# KnightOS development environment

This is a simplified version of [KnightOS][knightos]'s development environment
which I find a bit too complex for my own needs.

## Requirements

* Mono (for sass)
* GNU Make
* CMake

## Build

1. `git submodule init`
2. `git submodule update`
3. `make`
4. `cd hello`
5. `make run`
